<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">Well, my obsession with tech grew from seeing how much software impacts our daily routines. I started out by recreating platforms like YouTube and YT Music from scratch using HTML and CSS , but I’d always get carried away adding the features I felt were missing. I wasn't just building clones; I was trying to make the experience better by adding the "cool" functionalities I wished the original apps actually had.<br><br>Now, I’m a Computer Science student at UIC focusing on a Full-Stack path. While I’ve spent plenty of time on the technical side, engineering news apps with Python and Flask or redesigning interfaces with React, some of my biggest growth has actually happened in team environments and hackathons. I’ve found that I really thrive in that high-energy, collaborative space. These events have allowed me to build great connections with other developers and step into leadership roles where I can help guide a project from a rough idea to a finished product.<br><br>As I continue my education and career development, I hope I can fully take advantage of any opportunities that arise and eventually bring my skills to a company whose goals and values align my mine. I’m ready to apply my toolkit, from C++ logic to responsive design, to projects that make a genuine difference in how we interact with the web.</p>
